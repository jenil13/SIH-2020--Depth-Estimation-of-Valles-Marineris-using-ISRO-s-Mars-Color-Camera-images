## PS: Depth Estimation of Valles Marineris using ISRO’s Mars Color Camera (MCC) images.
### We are Comparing different models for solving the above problem statement
### 1. Pix2Pix using Wessesterian Loss :
#### THE MODEL WAS TRAINED FOR 120 EPOCHS, USING WASSERSTEIN LOSS

### 2. Pix2Pix using Binary Cross Entropy :
#### THE MODEL WAS TRAINED FOR 120 EPOCHS, USING Binary Cross Entropy
![OUTPUT](https://github.com/AkashKhamkar/NM392_Neural-Architects/blob/master/Images/Pix2pixBCE.PNG)
### 3. SAT2MAP 
#### THE MODEL WAS TRAINED FOR 120 EPOCHS
